# How Tailscale Works

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

## Core Components
- **Tailscale Coordination Server**:
  - Handles authentication
  - Facilitates NAT traversal
  - Distributes access policies
  - Manages key exchange
  - "Control plane" for the network

- **Client Software**:
  - Creates WireGuard interfaces
  - Connects to coordination server
  - Establishes direct connections
  - Handles routing, DNS, etc.

</div>
<div>

## Technical Foundation
- **WireGuard**: Modern, secure VPN protocol
- **DERP**: Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets
  - Fallback relay servers when direct connection impossible
  - End-to-end encrypted even through relay
- **NAT Traversal**:
  - STUN-like techniques
  - Hole punching
  - Path discovery
- **Authentication**:
  - OAuth/OIDC-based
  - JSON Web Tokens
  - Device-based keys

</div>
</div>

# Tailscale vs Traditional VPNs

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
<div>

## Traditional VPNs
- Central server required
- All traffic flows through server
- Single point of failure

</div>
<div>

## WireGuard
- Manual key exchange
- Static configuration files
- Requires server setup
- Works with existing servers
- More flexible but complex
- Excellent performance
- Strong security
- No built-in coordination

</div>
<div>

## Tailscale
- No central server needed
- P2P connections when possible
- SSO/identity-based access
- Automatic key rotation
- Works behind NAT
- MagicDNS for simple naming
- ACLs for access control
- Cross-platform clients
- Minimal configuration

</div>
</div>
